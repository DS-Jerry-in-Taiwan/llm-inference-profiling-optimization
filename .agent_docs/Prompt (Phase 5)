@workspace /new_task Phase 5: Documentation & Final Polish

We have successfully completed all experiments (Phase 1-4). Now, act as the **Technical Writer** to finish Phase 5.

# Step 1: Define Context & Specs
Create the following files in `.agent_docs/`:
1. `.agent_docs/phase5_agent_context.md`
2. `.agent_docs/phase5_task_specification.md`

(I will provide the content shortly.)

# Step 2: Execute Phase 5
1. **Create `README.md`**:
   - Use the results we gathered (1.65s Baseline, 0.64s Quantized).
   - Make it professional and include the `final_comparison.png`.

2. **Create `docs/methodology.md`**:
   - Explain the technical details of KV-Cache, ONNX, and Quantization.
   - Discuss the trade-offs we observed.

3. **Cleanup**:
   - Review the `src/` directory and add docstrings to the scripts if missing.
   - Ensure the repository is clean.
