@workspace /new_task Phase 1: Baseline & KV-Cache Development

I need you to act as the **Baseline Development Agent** for Phase 1.

# Step 1: Define Context & Specs
Create the following two files in `.agent_docs/` to define your role and task:

1. `.agent_docs/phase1_agent_context.md` (Defines your role as Inference Specialist)
2. `.agent_docs/phase1_task_specification.md` (Defines the coding tasks)

(I will provide the content for these files shortly.)

# Step 2: Execute Phase 1
Act according to your role defined in the context file.
1. Read the specs.
2. Implement `src/baseline.py`.
3. Run the baseline experiment.
4. Generate the results (JSON & PNG).

# Step 3: Report
After execution, provide a summary of the performance difference you observed between `use_cache=True` and `use_cache=False`.

Please ask me for the file contents.
